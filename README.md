# QRCode-detector
This project was undertaken as part of the course unit “Computational Techniques for Estimation, Detection and Identification” aiming to explore different techniques for object detection in images and analyze their performance. The specific aim of this project is to detect QR codes within images under realistic conditions. This involved working with a diverse dataset containing images with varying levels of luminosity and noise.
To achieve the aim of the project, two distinct approaches were implemented. The first one, a straightforward approach, used a built-in function in Matlab to evaluate its performance on the dataset, implemented in the file “Basic_QR_detector”. In the second approach, a more complex technique was used. In this case, Histogram of Oriented Blocks is used to perform the QR code detection. This second approach is composed of three files:
- The “HOG_feature” file is a function that calculates a histogram based on the gradients and magnitudes of the pixels;
- The “HOG” file is a function responsible for QR code detection within the image, using the histograms generated by the preceding function;
- The “QR_code_detector” file is the base file that controls the overall process. It also performs image modifications to improve the quality and, in return, improve the detection process.
